A nemzetközi találkozókon, együttműködő tevékenységeken és kulturális cseréken keresztül a résztvevők nagyobb környezeti tudatosságot, kritikus gondolkodási készségeket és közös felelősségérzetet fejlesztettek a vízkészletek védelme iránt.",
        mobilityConclusion2: "A projekt nemcsak erősítette az együttműködést a partners iskolák között, hanem fel is ruházta a diákokat, hogy kis lépéseket tegyenek, amelyek valódi és pozitív hatásokat eredményezhetnek közösségeikben és a környezetben.",

Ezek a prezentációk nem passzív ülések voltak, hanem ösztönözték a nyílt vitát, a kérdéseket és a kritikus gondolkodást, lehetővé téve a résztvevőknek, hogy átgondolják saját szokásaikat és a vízhelytelen használat szélesebb hatásait.",
